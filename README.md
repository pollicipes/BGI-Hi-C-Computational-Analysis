# BGI-HiC-Computational-Analysis
Scripts to analyze BGI HiC data and produce matrices and contact maps

### Installation:
Detailed instructions come within the `.ipynb` or `.html` flavours of the protocol `BGI HiC computational analysis  (Sandoval-Velasco et al., 2020)`

## HTML text version:

If the Jupyter Notebook world is not something you are into, it serves as well as a bioinformatics protocol to perform your analysis. Just download the `BGI HiC computational analysis  (Sandoval-Velasco et al., 2020).html` version, open it with any web browser and copy the instructions in order to your Terminal, run it, and it will work just fine.

### Using Jupyter Notebook:
Download the `BGI HiC computational analysis  (Sandoval-Velasco et al., 2020).ipynb` file and open it in Jupyter Notebook. See https://jupyter.org/install.html for details on installation. Make sure you install the Jupyter Notebook, and **NOT** the Jupyter Lab. Installation should not take more than 10-15 minutes on a desktop computer.

This notebook just contains the instructions to go from the `*.fastq` files to the generation of HiC matrices in the paper.
The software used is TADBit (Serra et al., 2017), invoked through the command line. 

If you install the Jupyter Notebook bash kernel (more info http://slhogle.github.io/2017/bash_jupyter_notebook/) you can directly run the commands in-situ in the notebook. Alternatively, you can run bash within the Jupyter Notebook default Python kernel if you add the characters: `%%bash` to the beggining of the each execution cell, so that the interpreter knows that it should use bash, and not Python, as the interpreter to use.
